# Codaisseur OIDC Server

In this project, we will attempt to implement an OIDC (Open ID Connect) Authentication/Authorization Server.

## Plan
In order to properly implement the server, we will have to follow a plan.

- [x] Implement Auth Server and Publish it to Heroku.
- [ ] Create a couple of API (Resource Servers) that need protection.
- [x] Decide if we will use Server Side Rendering (.ejs) or React.js
- [ ] Decide on the supported flows 

**More details TBA...**
